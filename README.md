# NBA Model 24-25: Progress & Lessons Learned

## Overview

This project represents my next step in building a more advanced sports prediction model, focusing on NBA player and team performance. My goal was to push beyond basic stats and incorporate deeper, more granular data into my predictions.

## What I Tried

- **Expanded Data Collection:**  
  I gathered more detailed player and game data, experimenting with new sources and formats. This included scraping, cleaning, and integrating data into Google Sheets for easier manipulation and analysis.

- **Usage Rate & Lineup Analysis:**  
  I attempted to model player performance based on usage rates, especially focusing on different combinations of five-man units on the court. The idea was to capture the impact of rotations and lineup changes on individual stats.

- **Google Sheets Integration:**  
  I continued to use Google Sheets as a central hub for data storage and quick calculations, which helped with visualization and rapid iteration.

## What Worked

- **Improved Data Skills:**  
  I learned a lot about data collection, cleaning, and integration. My ability to automate and manage larger datasets improved significantly.

- **Process Automation:**  
  Automating data pulls and updates into Google Sheets streamlined my workflow and reduced manual errors.

## What Didn’t Work

- **Complexity in Modeling:**  
  Diving deeper into complexity in one area (like usage rates by lineup) often meant I needed to increase complexity everywhere else (like predicting rotations and substitutions). This quickly became overwhelming and difficult to manage.

- **Rotation Prediction:**  
  Predicting the exact five players on the court at any given time proved to be much harder than expected. Rotations are influenced by many unpredictable factors (injuries, coaching decisions, foul trouble, etc.), which made my lineup-based usage models less effective.

- **Model Effectiveness:**  
  Ultimately, this version of the model didn’t perform as well as I hoped. The added complexity didn’t translate into better predictions, largely because of the challenges above.

## Lessons Learned

- **Holistic Complexity:**  
  When you increase complexity in one part of a model, you often need to do so everywhere else to maintain consistency and accuracy.

- **Preparation for Next Year:**  
  With more time and the lessons learned from this cycle, I’m optimistic about building a more robust and effective model for the next NBA season.

## Looking Forward

This project was a big learning experience. While the results weren’t what I hoped for, the process has set a strong foundation for future improvements. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned and continue refining my approach for next season.
